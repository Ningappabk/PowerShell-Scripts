Q. What Powershell Scripting Is?
PowerShell file contains a series of PowerShell commands with each command appearing on a separate line. To use a text file as a PowerShell script, its filename should have.PS1 extension. To run a script you need
o	Type the commands in a text editor
o	Save the file with .ps1 extension
o	Execute the file in PowerShell

Q. How You Can Rename A Variable?
To rename a variable,
Rename-Item- Path Env: MyVariable –NewName MyRenamedVar
Q. How You Can Convert The Object Into Html?
To convert the object into HTML
Get-Process l Sort-object – property CPU –descending l convert to – HTML l Out-file “process.html”
Q. What Is the Difference, In Powershell, Between A Function And An “advanced Function”?
This could be a trick question for an average candidate, but normally, good candidates should know that the only thing that makes a function advanced and unlocks the wonderful tooling which comes with it is : [CmdletBinding()].
A great candidate would be pretty enthusiastic about all the powerful tools enabled by advanced functions. Any PowerShell scripter who strives to build professional-grade tools should be thankful for all the work PowerShell is doing for us.
Q. You Have A Script Which Uses Read-host To Prompt The User For An Ip Address. You Need To Make Sure The User Inputs A Valid Ip Address. How Would You Do That ?
A good candidate would probably use one of 2 ways :
o	Splitting the address in 4 elements and try to cast them to a [byte]
o	A regular expression
A great candidate would use the much simpler and more robust method : let the .NET Framework do the hard work and just try to cast the input string to the [System.Net.IPAddress] class.
By the way, the candidate should know that what we get from Read-Host is a [string].
Q. How Would You Set A Registry Value With Powershell?
Yeah, we start easy, but it is not that intuitive. This requires knowing that there is no registry-specific cmdlets, so we have to use the registry provider and Set-ItemProperty.
The registry has been an integral part of Windows for ever, so this is hardly area-specific knowledge. It is very likely that any PowerShell scripter has already performed this task at least once, maybe even on a almost-daily basis.
Q. What Argument Can Be Used To Convert An Object Into A String Or Convert The Property Of An Object Into The String?
Expand is the argument that should be used with the property name to convert an object property simply into a string.

Q. How Would You Ping A Remote Computer With 5 Packets Using Powershell?
Again, this is basic stuff. I wouldn’t get caught up in ideology, the good old ping.exe is perfectly valid, as long as the candidate knows the option to specify 5 packets.
If you really want the more PowerShelly Test-Connection, then ask : I just want the command to return $True if the ping is successful and $False if it is not.

Q. Explain with an example how you can map a network drive in PowerShell?
To map a network drive in PowerShell you have to use the command like
# PowerShell Map Network Drive
$Net = $( New – Object – ComObject Wscript.Network )
$Net.MapNetworkDrive( “S:”, \\expert\guru99 )
In here the drive letter is “S:” and the Network share is called ‘expert’ on a computer called ‘guru99.’

Q. Mention what are the three ways that PowerShell uses to ‘Select’?
The most common way is in a WMI Query Language (WQL) statement. In this technique

This question is an fantastic opportunity get an insight into the candidate understanding of PowerShell core concepts and his/her favourite PowerShell features.
For example, one of the most fundamental difference between bash and PowerShell is that bash is text-oriented whereas PowerShell is object-oriented.
A good candidate should be able to tell that. A great candidate, would most likely go on and on about the benefits of the object-oriented nature of PowerShell.
Also, if a candidate cites 2 valid differences between the two languages, but not a major one, the candidate might have a partial knowledge of PowerShell.

Q.How would you ping a remote computer with 5 packets using PowerShell ?
